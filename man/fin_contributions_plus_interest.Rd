\title{Compute the value of a principle plus annual savings, at a compound interest over a number of years}
\usage{
fin_contributions_plus_interest(
  principal = 0,
  deposits = 0,
  rate = 0.05,
  yrs = 10,
  n = 12
)
}
\arguments{
\item{principal}{The initial investment at time 0.}

\item{deposits}{Optional periodic additional investment each year.}

\item{rate}{Annual interest rate (decimal)}

\item{yrs}{Duration of the investment.}

\item{n}{Compounding per unit time (e.g. 12 for monthly, 365 for daily)}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item Value after yrs
}
}
\description{
This function allows you to determine the final value of a principle, with optional additional
periodic savings, over a number of years at a given rate of interest.
}
\details{
None.
If an amount of $5,000 is deposited into a savings account at an annual interest rate of 5\%, compounded monthly,
with additional deposits of $100 per month (made at the end of each month). The value of the investment after 10
years can be calculated as follows...
}
\examples{
#
# Value of a principle after yrs years at rate \%\% return.
fin_contributions_plus_interest(principal = 5000, rate = 0.05, yrs = 10)
#
# Value of periodic deposits after yrs years at rate \%\% return.
fin_contributions_plus_interest(principal = 5000, deposits = 100, rate = 0.05, yrs = 10, n = 12)
#
# Value of principal + periodic deposits after yrs years at rate \%\% return.
fin_contributions_plus_interest(principal = 5000, deposits = 100, rate = 0.05, yrs = 10, n = 12)
