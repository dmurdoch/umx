\description{
Allows you to determine the final value of an initial \code{principle} (with optional
periodic \code{deposits}), over a number of years (\code{yrs}) at a given rate of \code{interest}.
}
\details{
None.
If an amount of $5,000 is deposited into a savings account at an annual interest rate of 5\%, compounded monthly,
with additional deposits of $100 per month (made at the end of each month). The value of the investment after 10
years can be calculated as follows...
}
\examples{
#
# Value of a principle after yrs years at 5\% return, compounding monthly.
fin_compound_interest(principal = 5000, interest = 0.05, yrs = 10)
# annual compounding
fin_compound_interest(principal = 5000, interest = 0.05, yrs = 10, n=1)
#
# Value of periodic deposit of $100/yr after 10 years at rate 7\% return.
fin_compound_interest(deposits = 100, interest = 0.07, yrs = 10, n = 12)
#
# Value of principal + deposit of $100/yr after 10 years at rate 7\% return.
fin_compound_interest(principal = 20000, deposits = 100, interest = 0.07, yrs = 10)
#
fin_compound_interest(deposits = 20e3, interest = 0.07, yrs = 10, n=1)
# manually
sum(20e3*(1.07^(10:1))) # 295672

# $10,000 invested at the end of each year for 5 years at 6\%
fin_compound_interest(deposits = 10e3, interest = 0.06, yrs = 5, n=1, when= "end")
