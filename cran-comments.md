## Changes
Response to previous CRAN Check: Removed 2 doi's that work outside cran, but fail CRAN check
looks like an issue with  jstor (journal archive) thinking CRAN page request is non-normal.

A dozen new features and many minor improvements.

## Test environments
* OS X 11.0.0, R version 4.1.1
* Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, R-devel, 32/64 bit
* 64-bit Linux, R version 4.1.1

## R CMD check results
* Status: OK

## No Downstream dependencies

Many thanks for all your work on the R project: It is deeply appreciated here!
