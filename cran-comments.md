## Changes
Changed http --> https, added trailing slashes, and followed moved content

Added umx citation to the Description field in the form Authors (year) <doi:.....>

(didn't change these two, which seem OK and which with :443 added don't resolve for me)
http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/umx moved to https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org:443/badges/grand-total/umx
http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/umx (moved to https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org:443/badges/umx)
