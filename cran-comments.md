## Changes
A dozen new features and a many minor improvements.

Note: one doi doesn't resolve every time for CRAN check, but works fine for the end user: 
I think it's an issue about jstor (journal archive) thinking CRAN page request is non-normal.

* OS X 11.0.0, R version 4.1.1
* Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, R-devel, 32/64 bit
* 64-bit Linux, R version 4.1.1

## R CMD check results
* Status: OK

## No Downstream dependencies
