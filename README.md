[Road map](https://github.com/tbates/umx/labels/enhancement), and [Tutorials](https://tbates.github.io) (let me know what you'd like, or perhaps a book?)

`umx` is a package designed to make [structural equation modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_equation_modeling) easier, from building, to modifying and reporting.

`citation("umx")`

If you use it, you should cite: Timothy C. Bates, Michael C. Neale, Hermine H. Maes, (2019). umx: A library for Structural Equation and Twin Modelling in R. *Twin Research and Human Genetics*, **22**, 27-41. [DOI:10.1017/thg.2019.2](https://doi.org/10.1017/thg.2019.2)


`umx` includes high-level functions for complex models such as multi-group twin models, as well as graphical model output.

Install it from CRAN:

```splus
install.packages("umx")
library(umx)
?umx
```

Most functions have extensive and practical examples (even figures for the twin models): so USE THE HELP :-).

See what is on offer with '?umx'. There are online tutorials at  [tbates.github.io](http://tbates.github.io).

`umx` stands for "user" OpenMx functions. It provides over 100 functions, but most importantly:

1. `umxRAM` that makes path-based SEM in R straightforward and `plot` for graphically display of your model.
2. A suite of twin modelling functions.

These are supported by dozens of low-level functions automating activities such as labeling, setting start values etc., and helping with data-wrangling, plotting etc.

Some highlights include:

1. Building Path Models
	* `umxRAM()` *# Take included umxPaths, the data provided in `data =` returning the model, along with a `plot` and `umxSummary`*
	  * Automatic labels on paths, start values
	* `umxPath()` *# write paths with human-readable language like `var = ` , `mean = ` `cov = `, `fixedAt=`. Quickly define a variance and mean ('v.m. = ') and more.*
2. Reporting output
	* `umxSummary(model)` # *Nice summary table, in markdown or browser. Designed for journal reporting (Χ², p, CFI, TLI, & RMSEA). Optionally show path loadings*
	* `plot(model, std=TRUE, digits = 3, ...)` # *Graphical model in your browser! or edit in programs like OmniGraffle*
	* `parameters(m1, "below", .1, pattern="_to_"))` *# A powerful assistant to get labels and values from a model (e.g. all 'to' params, below .1 in value)*
3. Modify models
	* `umxModify(model, update = )` *# Modify and re-run a model. You can add objects, drop or add paths, including by wildcard label matching), re-name the model, and even return the comparison. All in 1 line *
4. Twin modeling!
	* `umxACE` *# Twin ACE modeling with aplomb* paths are labeled! Works with `plot()` and `umxSummary`!
	* `umxCP`, `umxIP`, `umxGxE`, `umxCP`, `umxGxEbiv`, `umxSexLim`
	* ![umxACE](https://github.com/tbates/umx/blob/master/man/figures/ACEunivariate.png)
5. Easy-to-remember options
	* `umx_set_cores()`
	* `umx_set_optimizer()`
6. Many more miscellaneous helpers e.g.
	* `umx_time(model1, model2)` reports and compares run times in a compact programmable format (also "start" and "stop" a timer)
	* `umxHetcor(data, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")` *# Compute appropriate pair-wise correlations for mixed data types.*
	* Dozens more: Check out the "family links" in `?umx` and in any help file!
